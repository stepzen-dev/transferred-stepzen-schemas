### Overview

For a full tutorial on importing schemas into your StepZen project, the main [Readme](https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas) of this repository provides step-by-step instructions to do so.

## Preparing your Dev.to Configuration

<em>First step to importing a schema into your StepZen SDL (Schema Definition Language) is to prepare the API for import. If you already have your API configurations, [skip](#import) this section.</em>

1. Create an [dev.to](http://dev.to/) account. The username of your account will be added to your configuration file.

## Preparing your Github Configuration

1. Register a personal token, https://github.com/settings/tokens.
2. Add read/write permissions.

<em>The StepZen CLI will import the schema and request your authentication configurations. You can add the configurations in the command line or add the configurations after import.</em>

1. Before importing the schema, either create a new project or access your existing project in the command line.

Creating a new StepZen SDL project.

```bash
$ mkdir my-app
$ cd my-app
```

Access an existing project

```bash
$ cd my-existing-project
```

2. Importing the schema. As mentioned earlier, you can skip the configuration questions by pressing `[Enter]` and adding the configurations manually.

```bash
$ stepzen import devto-github
```

3. Now the project should include the following directory layout in your root folder. Add your credentials in the config.yaml to properly deploy the StepZen Endpoint.

```shell
🐒➔ tree
.
├── index.graphql
├── config.yaml
└── devto-github
    ├── article.graphql
    ├── repo.graphql
    ├── user.graphql
    └── README.md

1 directories, 6 files
```

The config.yaml configuration for devto-github.

```bash
configurationset:
  - configuration:
      name: dev_config
      username: 'YOUR_DEV_USERNAME'
  - configuration:
      name: github_config
      Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

4. Start up the StepZen Endpoint.

```bash
$ stepzen start
```

A successfull deploy should respond with the below CLI message. If it did not successfully deploy, post on [Github Issues](https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas/issues)

```bash
Watching /Users/username/Desktop/myapp/config.yaml for configuration changes
Watching /Users/username/Desktop/myapp for GraphQL changes

http://localhost:5000/foo/bar
Deploying to StepZen...... done

Successfully deployed foo/bar at 8:06:59 AM

Your endpoint is available at https://accountname.stepzen.net/foo/bar/__graphql
```

Done! The StepZen Dashboard should be deployed at `http://localhost:5000/foo/bar` with an explorer listing the query documentation. 🚀
